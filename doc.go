copyaudit

This is an example of a daemon that listens for a stream of copy-and-paste
audit messages from OpenText Exceed TurboX. This example daemon writes each
image to its own file and logs all text copy messages to a single file. This
program is not supported in any way, shape, or form, but is provided as an
example for the end-user to write their own daemon.

Set proxy.CopyAudit=2 in the ETX configuration to enable optional copy
auditing. Set proxy.CopyAudit=1 to cause ETX to exit if it cannot connect to
the copy audit daemon. Additionally set proxy.CopyAuditImage=1 to enable "Copy
Rectangle" image auditing. This is an undocumented feature of ETX. As such, the
flag and the protocol are subject to change at any time without notice.

Protocol (as supported by this example):
 The copy audit daemon listens on the abstract socket (Linux) or named pipe
 (Windows) "Exceed TurboX Copy Audit". On other systems, it listens on the Unix
 socket "/tmp/.X11-unix/ETXaudit"

 When ETX opens a socket, it will write the 8-byte string "ETXaudit" followed
 by the byte 0x9F (aka "CBOR start indefinite length array").

 The remainder of the protocol is based on CBOR. For more details on CBOR
 encoding, see http://cbor.io and/or RFC 7049.

 Each audit/copy event is a single CBOR Map. It will typically contain the
 field "Display", an unsigned number, and the fields "XApp", "User", and
 "IPAddress", all three of which (if present) are strings. The IPAddress field
 is the address of the remote user, not the address of the ETX proxy machine.
 The event may also contain one of "Text" or "Image". Currently, Image is
 always in JPEG format.  Text is sent as a CBOR "byte string" (not CBOR "text
 string") because it may be in any of the encodings supported by ICCCM, and is
 not necessarily UTF-8.

 There is no data sent from the audit daemon to ETX. ETX does not want to wait
 for confirmation that the audit message has been logged. Attempting to write
 data back to ETX may block (because ETX will never read it).
